# Spec — sdd-demo

Status: Approved

What to build. Written with `/write-spec`. Change only with the user's approval. Each requirement is
in EARS syntax and has an ID that tests cite.

## 1. Purpose and scope

A light-weight proof-of-concept app that takes a folder of CVs/resumes as plain-text files and extracts information from each one. The user enters a job description as the search input. The app finds and ranks the best matching CVs. The search must be intelligent and semantic, not only keyword matching.

**Problem.** A hiring manager, or a recruiter helping them, cannot rely on keyword search to find good candidates, because keywords do not capture the meaning of a job description. The manager then reads many CVs by hand, which is slow. Some important signals are not stated in a CV and must be deduced, for example the average time a candidate stayed in each job (about 6 months is a red flag).

**Scope (draft).**

- In: plain-text CVs in a folder; a job description as the query; semantic ranking; deduced signals such as average job tenure.
- Out: PDF input (decided with the user: plain text only); real CVs.
- Constraint: the sample data is a small subset of TalentCLEF 2026 Task A (English, development set), described in `data/talentclef-dataset-description.md`. Its records are synthetic. The relevance labels in `qrels.tsv` can serve as the expected results.
- Sample (user decision): 3 diverse job descriptions and 10 CVs, with at least 3 matching CVs per job description. In the dataset every CV is labeled relevant to exactly one job description, so a CV labeled for one job description is a non-match for the other two. Job descriptions (confirmed by the user): Healthcare Data Analyst (`29243`), Senior Mechanical/HVAC Engineer (`32447`), Retail Mortgage Loan Closer (`38671`).

**Outcome evaluation.** Ranking quality on the sample is checked by NFR-004, and the accuracy of extracted job dates by NFR-005. Whether the app improves hiring decisions is not measured.

## 2. Roles and glossary

- **Manager:** the hiring manager who decides whom to interview. Decision-maker.
- **Recruiter:** helps the manager. Uses the app the same way.
- **User:** a manager or a recruiter.
- **Candidate:** a person whose CV is a plain-text file in the CV folder.
- **Job description:** a plain-text file in the job-description folder.
- **Extracted attribute:** a fact read from a CV (EXT requirements).
- **Calculated attribute:** a value computed from extracted facts (CAL requirements).
- **Semantic match:** closeness in meaning between a CV and a job description, not keyword overlap.
- **Recommendation:** an LLM-generated statement on whether to interview a candidate for a job description.

## 3. User scenarios

Status of all scenarios: drafted by the assistant from the interview; approved with the spec.

**SCN-001: Find the best candidates for an open role.**

- Actor and goal: a hiring manager or recruiter wants to decide whom to interview for a role.
- Trigger and preconditions: the system has started; the job-description and CV folders contain plain-text files.
- Main path: the user selects a job description; the system shows all candidates ranked by semantic match, each with its extracted attributes, calculated attributes and an LLM recommendation; the user compares them and picks candidates to interview.
- Alternate and failure paths: an attribute cannot be determined (MIS-001, MIS-002); the LLM service fails (ERR-001, ERR-002).
- Observable result: a ranked candidate list with attributes and recommendations.
- Requirements: JOB-001, LST-001, JOB-002, JOB-003, RNK-001 to RNK-003, REC-001.

**SCN-002: Review one candidate.**

- Actor and goal: the same user wants to understand one candidate and see where the candidate fits.
- Trigger and preconditions: the system has started.
- Main path: the user selects a candidate; the system shows the raw CV, the extracted and calculated attributes, and the job descriptions ranked by match.
- Alternate and failure paths: as in SCN-001.
- Observable result: the candidate's raw CV, attributes and ranked job descriptions.
- Requirements: EXT-001 to EXT-010, CAL-001 to CAL-005, CAL-007 to CAL-010, LST-002, CND-001 to CND-003.

## 4. Functional requirements

| ID | EARS requirement | Priority | Status | Business reason | Source | Scenarios | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXT-001 | When the system starts, it shall read each plain-text CV file in the CV folder. | Must | Confirmed | The manager no longer reads CVs by hand. | User statement | SCN-001 | TBD |
| EXT-002 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's name. | Must | Confirmed | Identify the candidate in the ranked list. | User statement ("all of the above") | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-003 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's current job title. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-004 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's skills. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-005 | Withdrawn: replaced by EXT-010 and EXT-011. | — | Withdrawn | The user asked for more specific education attributes. | User statement (interview 1) | — | — |
| EXT-006 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's current address as a city and a country. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-007 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the list of countries where the candidate has worked. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-008 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the list of companies the candidate has worked for. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-009 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's last job: employer, location, duration, title, and a brief description. | Must | Confirmed | The last job shows current level and relevance. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-010 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the candidate's highest degree. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| EXT-011 | When the system reads a CV, it shall extract the list of university and major pairs the candidate attended. | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | Decision attribute. | User statement (interview 1) | — | — |
| CAL-001 | When the system reads a CV, it shall calculate the candidate's total employment period. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001 |
| CAL-002 | When the system reads a CV, it shall calculate the number of jobs the candidate has held. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001 |
| CAL-003 | When the system reads a CV, it shall calculate the candidate's average time per job. | Must | Confirmed | A short average, such as 6 months, is a red flag that the manager must otherwise deduce by hand. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001 |
| CAL-004 | When the system reads a CV, it shall identify employment gaps between jobs. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. | User statement ("all of the above") | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001 |
| CAL-005 | When the system reads a CV, it shall calculate, in months, the time between the candidate's graduation and today, whether the candidate was employed or not. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. Inference: "graduation" is the candidate's most recent graduation. | User statement | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-002 |
| CAL-006 | When the system reads a CV, it shall classify the move from the candidate's previous job to the last job by comparing seniority level and field: upgrade (higher seniority), downgrade (lower seniority), horizontal (similar seniority, different field or function), or same (similar seniority, same field). | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | Decision attribute. The LLM judges seniority and field from job titles and descriptions. A CV with a single job gives "Not available" (MIS-001). | User statement; user decision (accepted recommendation) | — | — |
| CAL-007 | When the system reads a CV, it shall determine whether the candidate is currently employed: yes when the last job is marked as current in the CV, no when the last job has an end date, and "Not available" when the CV gives the last job neither. | Must | Confirmed | Decision attribute. A missing end date must not read as "employed". | User statement (interview 1); amended 2026-10-14 (code review finding, user decision) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001, EX-003 |
| CAL-008 | When the system calculates a duration in months, it shall count both the start month and the end month, and treat "Present" as the current month. | Must | Confirmed | A job that ends in May followed by one that starts in June is not a gap, and the total employment period equals the span from the first start to now. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-001, EX-002 |
| CAL-009 | If a job in a CV has no end date and is not marked as current, then the system shall show "Not available" for the average time per job (CAL-003) and the employment gaps (CAL-004) of that candidate. | Must | Confirmed | The manager is not misled by a value built on a guessed end date (MIS-001). Any job with an unknown end makes the gaps "Not available", even when it is the last job: a per-job rule adds complexity for little gain. The job count, the total employment period and the time since graduation are unaffected. | User decision (2026-10-14, accepted recommendation); code review finding | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-003 |
| CAL-010 | If a job in a CV ends before it starts, or a job start, job end or graduation date is after the current month, then the system shall show "Not available" for the calculated attributes that depend on that date. | Must | Confirmed | The system never guesses (MIS-001), and a reversed range would otherwise give a zero or negative duration. A bad job date makes CAL-001, CAL-003, CAL-004 and CAL-007 "Not available"; a bad graduation date makes CAL-005 "Not available"; the job count (CAL-002) is unaffected. The extracted dates stay visible as written. Every future date counts as invalid, including a job end date a month ahead: the rule is simple, and the cost is that a legitimate future end date makes four attributes "Not available". | User decision (2026-10-14, accepted recommendation); code review finding | SCN-001, SCN-002 | EX-004 |
| JOB-001 | When the system starts, it shall read each plain-text job-description file in the job-description folder. | Must | Confirmed | Job descriptions are supplied as files in a separate folder, like the dataset's query files. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| LST-001 | When the system starts, it shall list the job descriptions. | Must | Confirmed | The user browses from either side. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| LST-002 | When the system starts, it shall list the candidates. | Must | Confirmed | The user browses from either side. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-002 | TBD |
| CND-001 | When the user selects a candidate, the system shall show the raw CV text of the candidate. | Must | Confirmed | The manager can check the source. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-002 | TBD |
| CND-002 | When the user selects a candidate, the system shall show the extracted attributes (EXT-002 to EXT-010, except withdrawn EXT-005) and the calculated attributes (CAL-001 to CAL-005 and CAL-007) of the candidate. | Must | Confirmed | The manager decides from these attributes without reading the CV. Inference: the user said "calculated attributes"; extracted attributes are included. | User statement, with inference | SCN-002 | TBD |
| CND-003 | When the user selects a candidate, the system shall show the job descriptions ranked by their semantic match to the candidate, best match first. | Must | Confirmed | The manager sees where the candidate fits best. The list has no LLM recommendation. | User statement (interview 1); user decision (no recommendation here) | SCN-002 | TBD |
| JOB-002 | When the user selects a job description, the system shall show all candidates ranked by their semantic match to the job description, best match first. | Must | Confirmed | The manager sees the whole ranking beside the LLM recommendation (REC-001). No threshold is needed. | User statement ("qualified candidates"); user decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| JOB-003 | When the user selects a job description, the system shall show the raw text of the job description. | Must | Confirmed | The manager reads the role beside the ranking. Mirrors CND-001 on the candidate side. It is shown together with the ranked candidates (JOB-002), on the same view. | User statement (2026-10-14) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| PRG-001 | When the system starts, it shall show the job-description list and the candidate list without waiting for the attributes and recommendations to be computed. | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | The user can browse the raw CVs right away. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | — | — |
| PRG-002 | While an attribute or a recommendation is being computed, the system shall show "Computing…" in its place, and replace it with the result when ready. | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | The user gets feedback during the wait. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | — | — |
| PRG-003 | The system shall compute the attributes of each CV once per start and reuse them in every view. | Must | Confirmed | Avoids repeated LLM calls and cost. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| MIS-001 | If the system cannot determine an attribute of a CV, then it shall show "Not available" for that attribute and shall not guess a value. | Must | Confirmed | The manager can tell a missing attribute from an extracted one and is not misled. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| MIS-002 | If the system cannot determine an attribute of a CV, then it shall keep the candidate in the candidate list and in every ranking. | Must | Confirmed | A gap in a CV must not hide a good candidate. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| ERR-001 | If the external LLM service is unavailable or rejects a request, then the system shall show an error message that names the cause. | Must | Confirmed | The manager knows why a result is missing. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| ERR-002 | If the external LLM service is unavailable or rejects a request, then the system shall keep showing the lists, the raw CV texts, and every result already computed, and shall show "Not available" for each result that failed. | Must | Confirmed | The app stays usable and nothing is faked. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001, SCN-002 | TBD |
| ERR-003 | When the user asks to retry after an LLM failure, the system shall repeat the failed requests. | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | Partial results can be completed without restarting. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | — | — |
| RNK-001 | The system shall rank by semantic match, not by keyword match alone. | Must | Confirmed | Keyword search misses the meaning of a job description. | User statement (interview 1) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| RNK-002 | The system shall not use the calculated attributes (CAL-001 to CAL-005 and CAL-007) to determine rank. | Must | Confirmed | The manager judges the red flags. Rank stays predictable. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | SCN-001 | TBD |
| RNK-003 | When the system shows a ranked list of candidates, it shall show for each candidate the extracted attributes (EXT-002 to EXT-010, except withdrawn EXT-005) and the calculated attributes (CAL-001 to CAL-005 and CAL-007). | Must | Confirmed | The manager decides from these attributes without opening the CV. | User statement | SCN-001 | TBD |
| REC-001 | When the system shows a ranked list of candidates for a job description, it shall show for each candidate a recommendation generated by an LLM on whether to interview the candidate for that job description. | Must | Confirmed | The manager decides from the attributes and the recommendation. | User statement | SCN-001 | TBD |

Use `AREA-NNN` for IDs, for example `PAY-001`. Distinguish Proposed, Confirmed, and Withdrawn
requirements. A confirmed requirement still needs the spec approval before implementation.

## 5. Non-functional requirements

| ID | EARS requirement | Priority | Status | Business reason | Source | Acceptance evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001 | The system shall send CV text and job-description text only to the external LLM service approved in `docs/design.md`. | Must | Confirmed | The user allows an external LLM service. `CLAUDE.md` requires every external data flow to be approved and listed in the design. | User decision (interview 1) | TBD |
| NFR-002 | The system shall not show, log or store the LLM service credentials in any message, log or file other than `config/.env`. | Must | Confirmed | A leaked key has cost and security impact. `CLAUDE.md` requires secrets to stay in `config/.env`. | `CLAUDE.md` (Security and privacy) | TBD |
| NFR-003 | When the system starts on the 10-CV sample with the external LLM service available, it shall have computed all extracted and calculated attributes within 2 minutes. | — | Withdrawn (user trim, interview 1) | The manager does not wait long. The 2-minute limit is the assistant's proposal, accepted by the user by following the recommendation. | User decision (accepted recommendation) | One manual run with the real service on the sample (automated tests cannot use a live LLM or a real clock, per `CLAUDE.md`) |

| NFR-004 | When the evaluation script runs on the sample with the live LLM service, then for each job description at least 2 of the 3 best-ranked CVs shall be labeled relevant to it in `ground_truth.tsv`. | Must | Confirmed | Shows the semantic ranking is not random (RNK-001). At least 3 CVs are labeled relevant per job description (section 1). The limit is the assistant's proposal, accepted by the user (2026-10-14); stricter limits are likelier to fail on 10 CVs. | User decision (2026-10-14, accepted recommendation); code review finding | One manual run of `python main.py --evaluate` by the user with the real service (automated tests cannot use a live LLM, per `CLAUDE.md`). The result is recorded in the design. |
| NFR-005 | When the evaluation script runs on the sample with the live LLM service, the extracted job start dates, end dates and current markers shall match the reviewed gold file `data/sample/gold_jobs.json` for at least 90% of the jobs. | Must | Confirmed | Extraction feeds every calculated attribute (CAL-001 to CAL-010). Dates are checked because they drive the calculations. The 90% limit is the assistant's proposal, accepted by the user (2026-10-14); it cannot yet be grounded in data. The gold file is drafted by the assistant, which is not independent evidence, so it counts only after the user reviews it. The evaluation reports counts, never CV content. | User decision (2026-10-14, accepted recommendation); code review finding | One manual run of `python main.py --evaluate` by the user with the real service. The result is recorded in the design. |

Use `NFR-NNN` for IDs. State the relevant workload, conditions, and measurable acceptance limits.
Keep unknown limits in the open questions. Do not invent values.

## 6. Acceptance examples

| ID | Requirement IDs | Situation and input | Expected result | Reviewed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EX-002 | CAL-005, CAL-008 | A CV lists a Bachelor's degree with "Graduated: May 2018" (invented, modeled on dataset CV `49`). Today is October 2026. | Time since graduation: 102 months (May 2018 to October 2026, counting both months). | User (approved with the spec) |
| EX-003 | CAL-001, CAL-002, CAL-003, CAL-004, CAL-007, CAL-009 | A CV lists three jobs: Jan 2018 to May 2019, Jun 2019 to Dec 2021, and Jan 2022 with no end date and no "Present" or other current marker. Today is October 2026. (Invented dates, as in EX-001.) | Number of jobs: 3. Total employment period: 106 months. Average time per job: Not available. Employment gaps: Not available. Currently employed: Not available. | User (approved with the amendment of 2026-10-14) |
| EX-004 | CAL-002, CAL-005, CAL-010 | Today is October 2026. (a) A CV lists two jobs: Jan 2018 to May 2019, and Jun 2019 to Mar 2019. (b) A CV lists a degree with "Graduated: May 2030".

## 7. Assumptions and open questions

| Item | Evidence or assumption | Consequence if wrong | Owner | Resolution or revisit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Withdrawn to trim the PoC (user, so it can be built in about an hour): PRG-001, PRG-002, ERR-003, NFR-003, CAL-006, EXT-011 | User decision, interview 1 | The start-up shows no progress, there is no retry and no timing target, and the career move, education pairs are not provided | User | Restore with a spec amendment |
| CAL-001: "total employment period" and "total years of experience" are treated as one attribute: the months from the first job's start to the current month (CAL-008), with gaps shown separately (CAL-004) | Inference: both were requested in some form and EX-001 gives 106 months | Duplicate or different attributes wanted | User | Accepted with the spec approval |
| Acceptance examples exist only for CAL-001 to CAL-005, CAL-007 and CAL-008. Other requirements have none yet | Tests cite requirement IDs; examples for the remaining rules can be written in the plan's tests | Rules without a reviewed example may be misread | User | Add examples by amendment if a misreading appears |
| The interface (command line, local web page, other). The user's flow is interactive: lists, then selection | The spec states behavior only; the design chooses the interface | Affects the layers, dependencies and UI tests | User, in `/write-design` | Decide in the design |
| Which external LLM service, and whether the semantic search also uses an external embedding service | User allows an external service (NFR-001). The choice is not made | Affects cost, secrets and privacy | User, in `/write-design` | Decide in the design with a `DEC-NNN` |
| NFR-005 checks job dates only. Other extracted attributes (name, title, skills, address, degree) have no accuracy target | Code review finding, 2026-10-14. The user accepted dates only | Errors in the other attributes go unnoticed except by eye in the UI | User | Add a requirement by amendment if a misreading appears |
| `data/sample/gold_jobs.json` does not exist yet and must be reviewed by the user before NFR-005 counts | The assistant drafts it from the CV text, which is not independent evidence | NFR-005 would measure agreement with the assistant, not the truth | User | Review the file when it is drafted (a plan milestone) |
| The dataset has no CVs labeled non-relevant (all 472 labels are `1`) | Inspection of `qrels.tsv` | The sample can test only that labeled CVs rank above CVs labeled for other job descriptions | User | Accept as a limit, or add synthetic non-matches |

## 8. Review and approval

**Approved by the user** on 2026-10-13, in the `/write-spec` interview ("i approve the specs").

- Scope: the whole spec as it stands, including the 34 Must requirements, scenarios SCN-001 and SCN-002, examples EX-001 and EX-002, NFR-001 and NFR-002, and the six withdrawn requirements (PRG-001, PRG-002, ERR-003, NFR-003, CAL-006, EXT-011) plus withdrawn EXT-005.
- The user declined a deeper cut (CND-003, CAL-004, ERR-002 and the second tier EXT-006, EXT-007, EXT-008).
- Left to the design (`/write-design`): the interface, the external LLM and embedding service, and the `DEC-NNN` for the external data flow.
- Amendments: record the approved change and affected IDs here. Preserve IDs and withdrawn rows.
  - **2026-10-14, approved by the user ("yes"), from an independent code review:** CAL-007 reworded (an unknown end date is no longer "Present"); CAL-009 added; EX-003 added; SCN-002 requirement list now includes CAL-009. Impact: `docs/design.md` section 3 (`Job` needs a current marker, the extraction reply gets one, the calculation rules change), the extraction prompt, `src/attributes.py`, `src/llm_schemas.py`, and the tests that cite CAL-007 (they change because the requirement changed).
  - **2026-10-14, approved by the user ("yes"), same review:** CAL-010 added (a job that ends before it starts, or a future date, gives "Not available" for the dependent calculated attributes); EX-004 added; SCN-002 requirement list now includes CAL-010. Impact: `docs/design.md` section 3 (calculation rules), `src/attributes.py` and its tests.
  - **2026-10-14, approved by the user ("yes"), a user request:** JOB-003 added (the job view shows the raw job description text beside the ranked candidates); SCN-001 requirement list now includes JOB-003. Impact: `docs/design.md` (a job response in the API, the job view layout), `src/workspace_views.py`, `src/api/jobs.py`, `src/web/`, and the tests.
  - **2026-10-14, approved by the user ("yes"), same review:** NFR-004 added (ranking quality on the sample, one manual run of `python main.py --evaluate`; the first draft named `scripts/evaluate.py`, changed with the user's approval on 2026-10-14); NFR-005 added (extracted job dates against a reviewed gold file, at least 90%); section 1 "Outcome evaluation" updated; two open questions added in section 7. Impact: `docs/design.md` (DEC-017: `src/evaluation.py`, the `--evaluate` flag and `data/sample/gold_jobs.json`; the Check columns of DEC-003 and DEC-004), and a plan milestone for the gold file.
